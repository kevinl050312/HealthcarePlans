# HealthcarePlans
Given some measures on a variety healthcare plans, which five are the plans that are the "worst" or most need further investigation?

This was a fun, open-ended project that required me to think through how to choose metrics that were simultaenously meaningful and supported by an understanding of the data. It especially rewarded a more rigorous initial exploration of the data, as that allowed me to challenge/confirm assumptions made, as well as form new expectations that helped in evaluating plans down the line.
